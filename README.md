# NoteBoard
This electronic note board is made of 36 panels

Each panel is using **Observer** design pattern to listen to the **state** of ColorGenerator that changes it's color every 2 seconds.

Used **Singleton** design pattern so that there is only a single ColorGenerator object.

There are four different patterns to paint the boards wach one is implementing **Strategy** design pattern.

The code is documented using **abstraction function** and **representation invariants**.
